        <h5 class="text-success text-capitalize">Was established in 1978</h5>
        <p class="text-muted">The purpose is to assist in the nurture, care and spiritual feeding of children in a Church School class setting. To share one’s faith with others and share God’s story as related to us in the Old and New Testament as well as what we believe as. Church is open daily and is free to all students, as we believe all can pray and wish and allow their own beliefs to flow. Being away from home doesn't mean you have to be away from your traditions and religions. All kind and respectful students are welcome here.</p>

      <p class="text-muted">The school auditorium is a beautiful and wonderful place for students to socialize. Every term many after school clubs preform and share the what they have learnt in the past several weeks. It is the perfect time to go onto stage and show the world what you've got, or sit back and admire and relate to other students. It's the perfect place to share talents and to socialize amongst classmates who have a desire to talk with one another. We all should share our knowledge and talent and the auditorium allows us to do so. All kind and respectful students are welcome here.</p>
